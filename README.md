# DDOS-Attack-Classification-and-Prediction-
A Machine Learning-Driven Defense System for DDoS Attack Classification and Prediction is a solution designed to enhance cybersecurity by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques. This system aims to identify, classify, and predict Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks in real-time, improving the overall defense strategy for networks and infrastructure.
Key Components:
1.Data Collection and Preprocessing: The system collects network traffic data, including packet sizes, transmission patterns, and user behavior. The data is preprocessed to remove noise and anomalies, ensuring high-quality input for the model.
2.Feature Extraction: Relevant features such as traffic volume, request rates, and IP diversity are extracted from the network traffic to create a profile of normal versus anomalous activity.
3.Classification Models: Machine learning algorithms (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks) are trained on historical attack patterns. These models classify incoming traffic as legitimate or malicious, enabling immediate detection of DDoS threats.
4.Prediction Models: Predictive models such as time-series forecasting (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) are employed to anticipate potential future DDoS attacks based on traffic trends and historical data, allowing for proactive defense measures.
5.Real-Time Detection and Response: The system continuously monitors network traffic, making real-time decisions on whether traffic is part of a DDoS attack. When an attack is detected or predicted, it automatically triggers defense mechanisms like traffic rerouting, rate limiting, or blackholing.
6.Adaptive Learning: The system regularly updates its models with new data, allowing it to adapt to evolving DDoS attack techniques, improving its classification and prediction accuracy over time.
